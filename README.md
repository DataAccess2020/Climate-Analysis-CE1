# Climate-Analysis-CE1
Class exercise from Catalina and Yaming

We decided to analyze how in favor people are against policies to subsidise Renewable Energies to Reduce climate change in Europe. Since Northern European Countries are much more advanced in policy-making and technology in comparison to Southern European Countries, using the European Social Survey Data we selected the corresponding countries, wrote a Research Question and Hypotheses in order to develop our research project.

The project contains an R Script, an R Markdown Report, a Graph Folder with the png files that correspond to our data visualizations and a final HTML as output file.
